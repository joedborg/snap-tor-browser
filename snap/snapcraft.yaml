summary: Tor Browser; protect your privacy
description: |
  The Tor software protects you by bouncing your communications
  around a distributed network of relays run by volunteers all
  around the world; it prevents somebody watching your Internet
  connection from learning what sites you visit, it prevents the
  sites you visit from learning your physical location, and it
  lets you access sites which are blocked.
